# Mask RCNN implementation to detect ice wedge polygons


Mask R-CNN is intended to perform instance segmentation,that is detec bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in an image.

The code is based on https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN using Python 3, Keras and TensorFlow using  a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.
