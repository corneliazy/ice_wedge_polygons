# Unet implementation to detect ice wedge polygons

Our objective was a pixel based image segmentation. </br>
Therefore, we created different sets of training data, different classes and different AOI extents for our prediction.
</br>
</br>
The satellite data, mask data, predicted images and trained models for each attempt can be found in the corresponding folder. </br>
The R Code for all attemps can be found in this (unet) folder.
